1_TruckLoadMarket_FileGroup_PartitionFunctionAndScheme.sql
1) Line 22 check name = '$TruckLoadMarket_Archive'.  That $ is an error from those snippets.
-- AP - Done
2) Line 41 change the dev file size to a lower amount, ran into space issues the other day cuz I left them that high.

1) approved

3a_DB01_TruckLoadMarket_Schema_Change.sql
1) I think you only need to drop foreign keys that reference the PK that is being dropped.
-- AP - I think you're right, but they're named incorrectly as is so this will name them according to conventions
2) Line 126 put the PK name there, another snippet related issue
-- AP - Done

3) For the section that removes PK's either this value will need to be changed each time to match the PK of the environment or a if statement determining which server and a section for dev/qa/prod will need to be added.
-- AP - Done, will change the QA PK when I know which env we are in

4) No foreign keys reference this pk, is the UX needed on this column?
-- AP - Removed UX

DEV__1_TruckLoadMarket_FileGroup_PartitionFunctionAndScheme
1) I didn't see this in git anywhere

DB01 - LoadToEquip.LoadToEquipment.sql
1) Does the PK constraint need the NONCLUSTERED keyword?
-- AP - I don't think it needs it because I believe it sees the CIX created on the table and makes the PK nonclustered but I added it

2) Add the new clustered index definition
-- AP - Added

3) Does RecordedDate need to be marked NOT FOR REPLICATION also?
-- AP - I think it is only needed on identity columns
